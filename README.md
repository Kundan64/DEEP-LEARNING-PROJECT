### **Image Classification Using CNN: Cat and Dog Classification**

**Introduction**
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision where a model learns to categorize images into predefined classes. One of the most common beginner projects in deep learning is classifying images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are specialized deep learning architectures designed to process image data effectively by detecting patterns, edges, and textures. In this project, we will build a CNN model to classify images as either a cat or a dog.

**Understanding CNN for Image Classification**
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning model designed to recognize patterns in images. Unlike traditional machine learning models, which require handcrafted features, CNNs automatically learn features from raw image data. A typical CNN architecture consists of the following layers:

Convolutional Layer – Extracts features like edges and textures using filters.
Activation Function (ReLU) – Introduces non-linearity to help the model learn complex patterns.
Pooling Layer (Max Pooling) – Reduces the spatial dimensions, making the model efficient and less prone to overfitting.
Fully Connected Layer (Dense Layer) – Maps extracted features to classification labels.
Softmax Activation – Outputs probabilities for each class (cat or dog).
